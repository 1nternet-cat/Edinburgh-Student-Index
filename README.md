# Drinking beer for the betterment of science 
This is a project where students (or whomever) drinks ten beers and takes a typing test every beer. The purpose of this is to provide pseudo random toy data for whatever application. <br>
<br>
Analyzing and optimizing patterns in how students perform worse with alchohol consumption has the potnetial to be far more interesting and relatable than many existing toy sets. <br>
<br>
To add simpply make a pull request with your/your group's data.
