# Drinking beer for the betterment of science 
This is a project where students (or whomever) drinks ten beers and takes a typing test every beer. The purpose of this is to provide pseudo random toy data for whatever application. In effect it is an avenue to free Github commits, an invitation to practice data analysis and an excuse to drink beer. <br>
<br>
Analyzing and optimizing patterns in how students perform worse with alchohol consumption has the potnetial to be far more interesting and relatable than many existing toy sets. <br>
<br>
To add simpply make a pull request with your/your group's data.
